# Practice: Create a taxi_zones asset

Letâ€™s use what you learned about creating dependencies between assets to practice creating an asset with dependencies.

In Lesson 3, you created a `taxi_zones_folder` asset that downloads a zipped directory containing a shapefile about NYC taxi zones.

Now, create a `taxi_zones` asset that uses the shapefile inside the `taxi_zones_folder` folder to create a table called `zones` in your DuckDB database. Recall that the path to this shapefile is stored in `constants.TAXI_ZONES_FILE_PATH`. This new table should have four columns:

- `zone_id`, which is the `LocationID` column, renamed
- `zone`
- `borough`
- `geometry`

You will need to use geopandas to open the shapefile, and the geopandas functions [set_crs()](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.set_crs.html), [to_crs()](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.to_crs.html), and [to_wkt()](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.to_wkt.html) to transform the Coordinate Reference System encoding from 'EPSG:2263' to 'EPSG:4326'; see [OpenNYC maintainer on GIS Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/27808) for additional details.

## Check your work

The asset you built should look similar to the following code. Click **View answer** to view it.

**If there are differences**, compare what you wrote to the asset below and change them, as this asset will be used as-is in future lessons.

    - Transform the CRS encoding of the geometry column from 'EPSG:2263' to 'EPSG:4326' (Enable lat / long visualizations)
